# python_match_case_example

This is going to be an example slash tutorial on match case

## Future plans

- [ ] 

## Important disclaimer

If any

### Getting Started

This repository contains a Python tutorial and example code demonstrating the use of the `match`/`case` statement introduced in Python 3.10. The main script, `main.py`, includes examples of pattern matching with dictionaries, JSON, lists, strings, and custom classes.

To get started, clone the repository and review the examples in `main.py`. You can run the script to see the output of various match/case patterns.

---

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.10 or later** is required, as the match/case statement does not exist in earlier versions.
- No external libraries are required; the examples use only the Python standard library (`json`).

---

### Installing

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/ErikPohl444/python_match_case_example.git
   cd python_match_case_example
   ```

2. (Optional) Set up a virtual environment:
   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies (if any):
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   *Note: Currently, `requirements.txt` is empty since only the standard library is used.*
